    <div id="definition-menu" class="hidden"><h2>What is Common Ground?</h2><p>Common ground is a shared opinion between you and a person with an opposing point of view.</p></div>
    <h1 class="main-heading">Why is <strong>Common Ground</strong> Important?</h1>
    <p class="text-body">Common ground allows you to find something you agree with when arguing with someone. Finding <i>common ground makes it easier to think from your opponent’s point of view when you disagree on something</i>, because there is something that you agree on. Without common ground, <i>you may be biased towards your opponent’s point of view because you can find something that you both agree on</i>, which makes it seem like there is nothing you can agree on which makes their point of view invalid in your eyes. When you find common ground, you are finding similarities between you and someone else that makes it easier for you to find the importance in someone else’s point of view and possibly reanalyze and reconstruct your own point of view because of valid points in the opposing point of view. The importance if common ground is shown in the article “A Quilt of a Country” when the author shows that America has been held together by a common enemy even when  different people had opposing points of view.</p>
    <h1 class="main-heading">How does <strong>Common Ground</strong> Allow you to View Something from Someone Else’s Perspective?</h1>
    <p class="text-body">When you have a shared opinion with someone else, it makes it possible to apply your understanding of them to something you disagree about, which makes it easier to see why an opponent thinks what they think. This idea is discussed in the Ted Talk “How to disagree productively and find common ground” when Julia Dhar is explaining how the best debaters use common ground as a tool to get to know and better understand their opponents <a href="#" onclick="$('#video-menu').toggleClass('active'); return false;">(3:42 – 5:39)</a>.<br><iframe id="video-menu" class="hidden2" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/phgjouv0BUA?start=222&amp;end=897" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
    <h1 class="main-heading">How does <strong>Common Ground</strong> Prevent Bias in an Argument?</h1>
    <p class="text-body">Common ground helps prevent bias because it helps solidify that your opponent still has valid views regardless of your own opinions. When you find something that can be agreed upon by two opponents, it eliminates potential biases toward someone else’s thoughts due to the fact that you both share an opinion. We see the opposite of this effect shown in the story “Once Upon a Time” written by Nadine Gordimer, when the wealthy families in the story are biased towards the people of other races because they believe that they don’t share any common ground between people of other races.</p>
